### Technologies used: 
- **React** 
- **Material UI**

### Problem Statement:
*An Internship for All Platform where students can apply for preferred internships and 
get info regarding the program as well. It will be a subdomain for KubixSquare.com, 
theme should be matching the parent website. Students should find it interactive and 
display should be concise.*

There are two different React apps used for the completion of the task
> *Main - Internship catalogue : This is the client-side web page that enables the candidate to choose an internships and submit application for the same.*
> <br/>
> *Interns - This is a dashboard created for the admin for viewing the metrics of candidates.*

*1. The Main catalogue website will display all the available internships to the client-side i.e.candidates*

*The site has a search by which the candidates can choose the desired internship. But ass this is a frnt end project the values are hard coded and some functionalities are compromised. Loreum Ipsum is used to fill the content.*

*Further on clicking "apply now", the candidate can view more details about the internship and get access to a form that the candidate can fill to submit thier application.*


*2. The Admin Dashboard will display the details about all internships.*

*Small Stats: These are 3 small charts displayed at top in the admin dashboard. They display numeric information regarding the total interns, internships and applications for the internships. Being concise they give a lot of useful information regarding to the admin.*

*Internships:
This chart displays a pie chart that shows which internships are the most popular among the interns who have applied.*

*Monthly interns
This chart gives the monthly interns rate and gives comparison with the previous month. This gives admin the clear view of the flux of interns.*
